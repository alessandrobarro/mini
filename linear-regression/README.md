This code implements linear regression, one fundamental linear model in ML.

The input dataset is provided by the user, who decides the number of features per example.

The user must also provide data regarding the outcomes correlated to the examples such as the number of intances (iterations) and learning grade (for gradient descent optimization).

After the model's parameters are trained (theta), the prediction can be made in the form y = theta^Tx + epsilon, where epsilon corresponds to the data's normally distributed noise.
