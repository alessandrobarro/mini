the code provides an algorithm able to solve any valid sudoku scheme inserted from the user.
the user prompts the scheme via cli.
at first, the algo will check if the provided scheme in compatible hence valid.
Then, the algo proceeds to find the corrisponding solution by a recursive approach, which serves an accessory function which
checks whether the inserted value in unique among the cols, recs and subcells, for all istances
